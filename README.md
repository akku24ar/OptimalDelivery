# Minor project : OptimalDelivery

This software is a route planning system and the purpose of this product is to provide the user with the most optimal and cost efficient route to the trucks between the pick-up point which is predetermined and the consumer.
Team 4 decided to use a command line interface that can be used on Linux, Microsoft, and MacOS systems by using the front end language, python. 
To approach this prompt, the team used agile methodology and scrum calls to address and come up with a solution in four sprints that involved: Requirements engineering; System Modeling; Architectural Design; Design and Implementation; Software Testing; and Evaluation.
All of these components helped us come up with a program that satisfies all the requirements.
